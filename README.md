# Hello-World
Just getting started with Android and Java. Looking forward to increasing my skill level with java. Would really like to build experience/skills and make some new friends with like interest in the process. This site is a Django Blog hosting site with ecommmerce Membership and Subscription capability. 

# Required Services:
Stripe Membership: You will need to setup an account with Stripe and add Developer API Keys both Publishable and Private keys

# TODOs:
1> Create_Blog and Blog_update API's are usable by any auth user. Presently needs restricted access for members only usage.
1> Create email listings with additional capabilities (customers/user toggling at admin level only) in Django.  

# Todays Status:
The site should be operational and run bug free with Post or Update checks in place.
