# Hello-World
just getting started with Android and Java. Looking forward to increasing my skill level with java. Would really like to build experience/skills and make some new friends with like interest in the process. This site is a Django Blog hosting site with ecommmerce Membership and Subscription capability. 

Required services: Stripe Membership: with developer API Keys both Publishable and Private keys

# TODOs:
1> Fix membership model.py import statment to match revised User signin 
2> Create membership test before allowing Post or Update access 
3> Create email list capability in Django 

# Todays Status:
Requires membership model.py import statement fixed (file damaged during upload). Once that is completed, the site should be operational and run bug free without Post or Update checks in place. 

# Credits:
Thanks to Mitch Tabian at CodingWithMitch.com for his project help Building A Website With Django. I would also like to thank Nick Walters for his expertise with Django stripe membership.
