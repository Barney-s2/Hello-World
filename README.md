# Hello-World
Just getting started with Android and Java. Looking forward to increasing my skill level with java. Would really like to build experience/skills and make some new friends with like interest in the process. This site is a Django Blog hosting site with ecommmerce Membership and Subscription capability. 

# Required Services:
Stripe Membership: You will need to setup an account with Stripe and add Developer API Keys both Publishable and Private keys

# TODOs:
1> Create A test for Ecommerce Membership before allowing Post or Update access.
2> Create email list capability (customers/user toggling at admin level only) in Django.  

# Todays Status:
The site should be operational and run bug free without Post or Update checks in place. 

# Credits:
Thanks to Mitch Tabian at CodingWithMitch.com for his project help Building A Website With Django. I would also like to thank Nick Walters for his expertise with Django stripe membership.
